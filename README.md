# Mocking With Vitest

This repository is my playground for learning TDD with Vitest.

The components that are being tested are VueJS components. I'm also mocking the Axios library.

The mock for the axios library is contained in `__mocks__` and is intended to be configurable via the `initialize` function called inside of the different test blocks.
